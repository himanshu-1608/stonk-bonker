# stonk-bonker
I couldn't find a place to select stocks that I wanna observe and create different graphs just by clicking some check-boxes, so I am creating my own stock stalker.
Components of Stonk Bonker:
1. Show different types of stocks chart. These types will include:
  - Day Open, High, Low, Close Chart  (OHLC)
2. Will be creating custom queries for my hypothesis, and backtest it for data from 01 Jan 2015 to present.

Final aim of Stonk Bonker:
To give me a set of stocks that are profitable pre-calculated by some aggregations
